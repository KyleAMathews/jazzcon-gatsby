We will discuss what mentoring is not, what mentoring is, factors for effective mentorship, and why it's important to the developer community.\r\n\r\nThere is an ongoing mantra within the developer community: that there are far more jobs available then programmers to fill them. Which should be an indication as to the wonderful potential for both business and those learning to code. Yet what often follows such statements are not words of joy but rather a list of frustrations related to the difficulty in finding and retaining enough skilled developers to fill these positions.\u00a0\r\nThe challenge is not in the number of newbies entering the field but the number who leave because they are not able to bridge the divide between bootcamps, online tutorials, books, videos, etc. to an employable developer who is able to contribute to the team.\u00a0\r\nI have years of experience working with learners of various ages in helping them develop the skills they needed to be successful at whatever their chosen goal. I understand that for businesses to be successful, they must develop more effective and efficient ways of recruiting and retaining developers in order to meet organizational benchmarks.\u00a0\r\nThe developer community is a overwhelmingly generous one and a well designed mentoring or apprenticeship program could be one answer that business leaders and newbies are looking for.\u00a0\r\n\r\n- The business costs associated with corporate hiring managers inability to recruit and retain skilled workers to fill current and future entry-level positions are increasing (Queen, 2014). \r\n- 89 percent of organizational leaders stated that they are having difficulties filling open positions, which is causing them to either turn down orders, miss key deliverable deadlines or hire individuals from outside of the United States (Aho, 2015). \r\n\r\nAho, K.

In the beginning, it was managed with callbacks, which unfortunately led to callback hell. Next, came Promises, which untangled the nested callbacks and yielded powerful mapping constructs over eventual values. However, even with Promises, it was difficult to express meaningful, readable control flow and manage errors. While these patterns are still useful, their limitations have become apparent. In this talk, explore two newer patterns for managing asynchronous code with more meaningful semantics. First, learn about async functions, which will land in the ES2017 spec of JavaScript. Async functions allow asynchronous code to be written in a synchronous manner and are already natively available in some browsers. Investigate several use cases and \"gotchas\" of async functions and learn how they work with Promises. Next, discover Observables via RxJS and how they provide a more powerful construct for operating on eventual values similar to Promises. Observables offer a more robust and meaningful API compared to Promises and can easily work with various event sources such as DOM events, WebSockets, and REST API's. Leave this talk with better confidence and ability to handle asynchronous code in JavaScript.","persons":[{"id":129,"full_public_name":"Jeremy Fairbank","abstract":"Jeremy Fairbank is a remote web developer in Tennessee.

Redux is a simple but powerful library that wrangles state and makes it easier to reason about and update in a unidirectional manner. Redux Saga is a library built upon ES2015 generator functions that makes managing application side effects a breeze with Redux. In this talk, dive into these two technologies and discover how useful they are for building applications in a more testable and deterministic manner. Explore the Redux architecture, including stores, reducers, actions, and middleware. Learn about JavaScript generator functions and how to declaratively manage side effects with Redux Saga. Say goodbye to mocks and spies and see how easy it is to test API calls and asynchronous events. Finally, express more complex constructs such as barrier synchronization and background tasks with Redux Saga's declarative operators.
